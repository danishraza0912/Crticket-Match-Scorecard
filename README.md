# Crticket-Match-Scorecard
This project was part of a Python course offered by our Institute IIT PATNA. The project prepares the Scorecard of the cricket match with the help of the commentary.
The program uses regular expression matching to get the scores of each player from txt file. After storing all the scores of players, the scorecard is prepared in a separate txt file named scorecard.
